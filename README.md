## Introduction

Welcome to `pxt-offline-extensions` by Elecfreaks! This repository provides a set of extensions for MakeCode that have been converted into `.hex` files, allowing users who cannot access the online MakeCode editor to use these extensions offline.

## Usage

To use our extensions with the offline MakeCode editor, follow these steps:

1. **Download the `.hex` file**

   Download the desired `.hex` file from this repository. Each extension has its own corresponding `.hex` file, so make sure you select the right one for your needs.

2. **Import the `.hex` file**

   - Open the offline MakeCode editor.

   - Navigate to the "Extensions" page.
